I implemented useState, useEffect, custom hooks applying code reuse.

- Get a random cat fact from the https://catfact.ninja/fact API.

- And with the first 3 words of the fact, request an image of a cat from the https://cataas.com/cat/says/hello API.

- Show the result on the screen.

- Add a button that changes the fact and propagates the change in the application.
